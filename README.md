#Update

We are aware that there is a bug with ```this.requestFullScreen();``` but, we left it so we do not have to change anything when it's changed.

#What is Video.js?

Video.js is a extendable, custom HTML5 Video player. Learn more at http://videojs.com

#In the future

1. Add more custom features
2. Add a option for full screen that you can disable making go of full screen (Be Careful With That One!)
